    "Hello! This document will go over the basics of building a DLL with C++ that can be used in Unity C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unity works within the Microsoft .NET framework and uses C# as the scripting language. This means that a shared library (DLL) built within the same framework can be used instead of compiled native C# code. Why might we want to do this? C# is easy to write and understand, but at the end of the day it is much slower than binaries built using C++. You probably know all this already, if you're reading this you maybe feel more comfortable using C++ than C#!\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a C++ library? Essentially, it is a package containing compiled code. Normally we write programs with a `main` function, but in a library we omit the `main`. Instead, we have a collection of functions which can be called."

    "- Desktop development with C++\n",
    "- Universal Windows Platform development\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these tools are installed, create a new VS project. Here you can select Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) and name it accordingly. Right click the name of the project and go into properties. Under *Configuration Properties* > *General*, ensure that *Configuration Type* is set to *Dynamic Library (.dll)*, and under *Configuration Properties* > *Advanced*, under *C++/CLI Properties* set *Common Language Runtime Support* to *Common Language Runtime Support (/clr)*.\n",

    "#### The C++ Side\n",

    "To let the DLL know that you are writing a function for an external platform, functions need to be wrapped in a syntax. Consider a function prototype defined in a header file, consider a function\n",

    "void function(typename2 arg1, typename2 arg2);\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an interface between the library and C#, a common data structure must be defined, this data structure should contain only primitive types (built in types such as int, double, char, etc). I have not experimented with more complex types. Your mileage may vary. An example of a simple struct to use is:\n",

    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here I am choosing to use float values as the Unity package uses almost entirely floats as the real primitive. This is pretty straightforward.\n",
